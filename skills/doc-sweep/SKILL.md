name: doc-sweep
description: Use when a repo's accumulated agent docs need a retrospective tidy - session notes, handoffs, scratch files, stale plans/specs, historical records, and living reference docs piling up across docs/, root, or .claude/. Triggers include "sweep the docs", "tidy up the docs/notes", "audit our docs", "which of these can we archive", "the notes in this repo are a mess", "doc rot". Not for reformatting one messy doc for readability (doc-reformat), starting or resuming a living doc (living-doc), writing a spec or plan (write-spec / writing-plans), parking a work item (backlog), or trimming tests (test-trim).

# doc-sweep

Repo-wide, retrospective tidy of agent-generated docs. Audit every doc, report
capped numbered findings, mutate **only what the human approves**. Read-only
until the gate.

Everything else in the ecosystem operates on one doc or one flow in the
present task. doc-sweep is the only repo-wide, class-driven, retrospective pass.

## Scope

All repo markdown except:

| Excluded | Detect via |
|---|---|
| Product/user-facing docs | publication plumbing (mkdocs.yml, docusaurus, sphinx, vitepress, CI deploying docs/), standards filenames (README, CHANGELOG, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE), content addressing the software's *user* not its *builder* |
| Vendored/generated | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `site-packages/`, any `.gitmodules` path, "auto-generated"/"DO NOT EDIT" banners |
| Managed ADRs | `adr/`/`decisions/` with numbered records - at most a `status: superseded` line, never content |
| Instructions | SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md bodies - audited as evidence, config-semantics edits belong to agent-config |

Ambiguous file = out of scope, named in the report ("excluded, appears stale").
A false exclusion costs a report line; a false inclusion damages user docs.

`$ARGUMENTS` path/dir = run the full pipeline scoped to it. Single file is
fine - intent here is lifecycle state, not readability.

## Classes

Exactly one class per doc (a doc that is both is the rot):

- **living** - source of truth about today (reference, methodology, runbook). Fixable in place.
- **snapshot** - dated record of a moment (session notes, handoffs, specs, plans, postmortems, anything in history/old/archive dirs). Immutable: banners at most.
- **scratch** - disposable working notes. Report-only (see Untracked rule).
- **mixed** - living methodology + appended dated log in one file. Default action: EXTRACT.

Decision order: location/dir name > top-of-file content > filename date >
frontmatter status. **Frontmatter lies** (`docs/old/` files say `status:
verified`); location and top-of-file banner outrank it. Plain reference doc
with no signals = living.

## Convention deference

First move: read the repo's own convention docs - lifecycle skills in
`.claude/skills/`, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/README doc maps. Adopt the repo's
vocabulary (its status words), locations (its archive dirs), and disposal
targets. If the repo's convention conflicts with this skill's defaults, the
convention wins on *where things go and what they're called*; the Never-list
below wins on *safety*. The conflict itself is a FLAG.

Most proposals should read as "enforce your own rules" - easy approvals.

## Phases

### 1. Inventory (mechanical, everything)

```bash
git ls-files '*.md'; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard '*.md'
git check-ignore <paths>          # ignored = report-only tier
git log -1 --format=%cs -- <file> # last touch
grep -rn '<filename>' --include='*.md' .   # inbound refs (from live files only)
```

Per file: path, lines, class, tracked?, inbound refs. Untracked files with no
archive convention → one question at the gate, only if archive/extract
findings exist (default `docs/archive/`, or the repo's existing archive dir).

### 2. Audit (mechanical first; read living + mixed only)

Mechanical checks, every doc:
- Tracked doc referencing an untracked/ignored path (dangles on fresh clone)
- Stale file/script/env refs in living docs (`test -e`, grep)
- Living doc contradicting repo state (grep the referenced config/source)
- Unbounded growth: mixed doc with dated entries - split at the
  self-declared era boundary: entries from before it extract, current-era
  entries stay
- Rules-file drift: tables/counts/commands vs reality (skills table vs `.claude/skills/`, cited commands that cannot run)
- Byte-identical duplicates (`cmp`)

Then read living + mixed docs (never snapshots - a wrong diagnosis with a
correction banner is the *healthy* end state, not rot). >10 content-read docs
or >120KB total → dispatch read-only subagents per doc, returning findings
records only, never doc bodies.

Untracked/ignored files: inventory them, report risk (no git history, no
backup), never propose or apply an action unless the human names it - even
when the repo's own lifecycle mandates a promotion. Untracked scratch is the
owner's intent; violating it beats stranding findings.

### 3. Report (chat, capped)

```
## Doc sweep - <repo>, <date>

Inventory: N docs - a living, b snapshot, c mixed, d scratch (e untracked/ignored).
Required reading: X lines across living docs.

### Findings
N. ACTION - path [mechanical|judgment]
   Evidence quote. -> proposed change (diff for FIXes)

### Key decisions (named-only; never under "apply all")
K. ...

### Excluded / healthy
- ...

### Gate
Apply which? "apply all" (ordinary only), numbers, or key-decision numbers by name.
```

Cap: **10 ordinary findings**, ranked by required-reading lines saved + rot
severity; key-decision findings exempt from the cap. Overflow → one-line
backlog entries. Evidence tier on every finding: `[mechanical]` (grep/git
output) or `[judgment]` (reading; budget human review there).

### 4. Gate (chat text, not modals)

Two classes:
- **Ordinary**: ARCHIVE, EXTRACT, MARK, mechanically-verified FIX. Rides under "apply all".
- **Key**: anything touching rules files (README/AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
  tables/counts - mechanical fixes only, never rule semantics), DELETE,
  untracked/ignored-file actions. Named individually, even inside "apply all".

Amendment that narrows an action ("2 but keep the 08-15 entry") → re-print the
amended finding, one confirm, then apply. Pure selections execute directly.

The report ends the turn. Apply starts only on the user's next message.

### 5. Apply (next turn, from the report)

1. Clean-tree guard (`git status`); dirty → ask. Per-file: anything changed
   since audit → skip and report, never overwrite.
2. Moves first (`git mv`, no content change), then edits - pure renames stay
   pure. EXTRACT is byte-verbatim (doc-reformat's verbatim contract); entry
   moves to `<archive>/<stem>-<oldest>-to-<newest>.md`, pointer line left.
3. Banners: strict 2 lines (status + pointer). Long context belongs in the
   successor doc, never the banner.
4. Frontmatter `status:` on acted-on files only (never repo-wide retrofit);
   use the repo's vocabulary if it has one.
5. Update inbound links (grep old paths across live docs).
6. Verify: old-path grep zero hits outside archive, links resolve,
   before/after required-reading count. `git add`, never commit.

## Actions

| Action | On | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| FIX | living | Mechanically-verified facts only (dead path, count, checkable status) - diff shown. Judgment stays FLAG. |
| EXTRACT | mixed | Move dated entries byte-verbatim to archive, leave pointer |
| ARCHIVE | living/snapshot | `git mv` to repo's archive dir + 2-line banner + `status:` |
| MARK | snapshot | Banner/frontmatter only, no move, no content - only when its status reads wrong; a terminal record already correctly filed needs nothing |
| FLAG | any | Needs human judgment - both sides quoted, no proposed fix |
| DELETE | tracked byte-identical dupes only | Key class; untracked files are never deleted |

## Never-list

- Never mutate before the gate - no "obvious" fix slips through.
- Never rewrite snapshot bodies; never resolve a load-bearing contradiction
  silently (FLAG it).
- Never edit content of untracked/ignored files.
- Never delete untracked/gitignored files, or anything not byte-identical-tracked.
- Never prose-rewrite a living doc where a mechanical fix suffices - FIX is
  surgical, shows a diff.
- Never touch product docs, vendored/generated docs, changelogs, managed ADRs.
- Never write report/state files into the repo; no audit log, no frontmatter retrofit.
- Never run project code to verify claims; static checks only.
- Never commit or push.

## Idempotency

No state files. The docs are the state: each run re-derives everything, and
applied actions leave mechanically visible postconditions (file in archive dir
with banner, entries gone from master, fixed paths exist) - the next run sees
"correctly filed" and skips. Stored `status:` is a signal, not truth.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Rewriting an archived doc's wrong diagnosis | Wrong-with-banner is the healthy end state. MARK at most. |
| Deleting the era-doc or shipped plan | Archive, don't delete - the record outranks tidiness |
| "Improving" a living doc's prose while fixing one path | FIX is the diff shown in the report. Nothing else. |
| Trusting `status: verified` frontmatter | Location + top-of-file banner outrank frontmatter |
| Flagging every orphan | Orphan only matters for living docs; dated records are legitimately unlinked |
| Report dumped into a file | Chat, capped. Files rot; the backlog catches overflow |
| Acting on an untracked scratch "to rescue it" | Report the risk; the human names the action |
| Punting a stale-status finding to FLAG because the fix touches a few lines | If repo state mechanically decides the truth (config value, file existence, count), it is a FIX - show the surgical diff. FLAG only when evidence cannot say which side is right. |
| Asking where archives go on a clean run | Only when archive/extract findings exist and no convention detected |
